# Coursera-Capstone-Project-MachineLearning-Python

In this project we'll analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles they'll like.

We load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. We use the following algorithms to build our models:

-k-Nearest Neighbour
-Decision Tree
-Support Vector Machine
-Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

-Jaccard index
-F1-score
-LogLoass
