# Coursera-Capstone-Project-MachineLearning-Python

>In this project we'll analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles they'll like.

We load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. We use the following algorithms to build our models:

  1.k-Nearest Neighbour
  2.Decision Tree
  3.Support Vector Machine
  4.Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

  1.Jaccard index
  2.F1-score
  3.LogLoass
